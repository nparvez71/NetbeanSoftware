// Chapter 10 Exercise 4
/*
 Write a program that, for a given String object defined in the code, writes strings to a file
 in the local character encoding (as bytes) corresponding to all possible permutations of the words
 in the string. For example, for the string the fat cat, you would write the strings
 the fat cat, the cat fat, cat the fat, cat fat the,  fat the cat, and fat cat the to the file,
 although not necessarily in that sequence.
 (Don't use very long strings; with n words in the string,
  the number of permutations is n!, so a string with 10 words has 3,628,800 permutations!).
*/

/*
 This exercise is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
 Creating all permutations of the words in the phrase is the most difficult part of the exercise.
 If you can crack this, then writing the file is trivial :-)
 I chose to use a recursive approach because it is relatively easy to understand, especially
 if you consider how an example might work..

 Suppose we want to obtain pernmutations of 4 words. You can reason as follows:

  * You can get the permutaions that start with the first word by obtaining the permutations
    of the remaining three words and appending them to the first word.
  * There are four possible first words, so if you repeat the process for each possible first word,
    you will have all possible permutations.
  * You can get the permutations of the remaining three words in each instance in the same way - append
    each of the permutations of the last two words and to the first word. Repeat this for the three possible
    first words.
  * Of course, there are two permutations of two words, the first followed by the second, and the second
    followed by the first.

 All you need to do is implement this as a recursive method.
 A limitation of the method I have implemented is that it ignores the possibility of duplicate words.

 The file should be written in the default charset, which leadsd to a BufferedWriter as the best choice
 for output to the file. Writing the data in the default charset means that the file is easily readable.
 You can view the contents with Notepad to check that it works.
