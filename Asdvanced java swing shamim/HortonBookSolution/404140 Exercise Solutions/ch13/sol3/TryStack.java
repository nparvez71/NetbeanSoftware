// Chapter 13 Exercise 3

/*
 Modify your Stack<> type to make it serializable.
 Demonstrate that this is the case by creating a
 Stack<String> object, adding 10 strings to it,
 serializing and deserializing the Stack<String> object,
 and listing the contents of the deserialized stack.
 */

/*
 Not quite so easy as the previous exercise, but not difficult either.
 This just involves applying what you learned in the previous chapter
 to the Stack class.
 Making Stack serializable only requires that it inplements the Serializable
 interface and defines the serialVersionUID member. Its data members are all
 serializable.
