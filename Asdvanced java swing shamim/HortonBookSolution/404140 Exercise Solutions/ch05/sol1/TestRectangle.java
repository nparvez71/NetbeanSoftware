//Chapter 5, Exercise 1
/*
 Define a class for rectangle objects defined by two points,
 the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle.
 Include a constructor to copy a rectangle, a method to return a rectangle object
 that encloses the current object and the rectangle passed as an argument,
 and a method to display the defining points of a rectangle.
 Test the class by creating four rectangles and combining these cumulatively
 to end up with a rectangle enclosing them all.
 Output the defining points of all the rectangles you create.
