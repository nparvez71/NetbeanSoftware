// Chapter 16 Exercise 3

/*
 Extend the result of the previous exercise to incorporate two supervisors
 for two teams of clerks, where the supervisors each run in their own thread.
 The supervisor threads should receive transactions from transaction sources
 and pass them to the clerks they supervise. The supervisors’ work should result
 in a variable time delay in transferring transaction to the clerks of between
 100 and 500 milliseconds.
 */

/*
  This is not an easy exercise. The addition of the supervisors and the delays
  they introduce in processing transactions adds a lot more potential for things
  going wrong. The exxample now has the transaction sources, the supervisors and the
  clerks all running in separate threads.

  You need to be sure that the clerks continue working when their in tray
  is empty until the supervisor notifies them that there are no more transactions. If
  you manage to get this working satisfactorily you are to be congratulated. Multi-threaded
  programs are extremely difficult to write in general and even more difficult to debug.

  I increased the number of accounts to make the solution more interesting. I made the supervisors
  create their own team of clerks - three in my solution. This way the supervisors manage when
  the clerks start and stop work.
