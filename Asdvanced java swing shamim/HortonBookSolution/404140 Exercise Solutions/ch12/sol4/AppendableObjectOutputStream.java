// Derived stream class to allow appending to an existing object file
/*
  The ObjectOutputStream constructor write a header to the file, regardless of
  whether the file exists or not. This results in an extra header being written at
  the end of an existing file that is opened in append mode. This results in a
  StreamCorruptedException when reading of any objects added to the file.

  This derived class allows objects to be appended.
  By using a factory method to create class object, we can set the append flag
  to signal when objects will be appended to an exixting file.
  This enables the override of the writeStreamHeader() method from the base class
  to decide whether or not the stream header should be written.
  You cannot construct the objects directly because the comnstructor must call
  the base class constructor first. This means you cannot set the append flag
  before the base class constructor is called, and it is the base class
  constructor that calls the writeStreamHeader() method.
