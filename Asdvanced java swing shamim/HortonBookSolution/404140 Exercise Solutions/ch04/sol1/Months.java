/*
 Create an array of String variables and initialize the array with the names of the months from January to December.
 Create an array containing 12 random decimal values between 0.0 and 100.0.
 Display the names of each month along with the corresponding decimal value.
 Calculate and display the average of the 12 decimal values.
